BUY ALERT

PRICE SHOULD CLOSE ABOVE 20 DAYS SMA

MACD MUST BE IN BUY MODE 

WELL SOMETIMES

PRICE WOULD HAVE CLOSED ABOVE 20 DAYS SMA

RSI WOULD HAVE CROSSED 50

BUT

MACD STILL NOT GIVEN BUY SIGNAL

IN SUCH SCENARIOS WAIT FOR MACD TO CROSS

RSI JUST CROSSES 50 MARK ON FRIDAY

BUT 

MACD STILL NOT GIVEN BUY CROSSOVER 

ONE MAY BUY IN ADVANCE AT CROSS OF HIGH OF FRIDAY HIGH WITH STOP-LOSS AS 1% BELOW FRIDAY'S LOW

IF MACD IN COMING DAYS GIVES BUY CROSS THEN SUPERB 

ONCE U ENTER THE TRADE APPLY 20DSMA AS TRAILING STOPLOSS.. ONE CLOSE BELOW 20DSMA AND IMMEDIATE BREACH OF THIS CLOSING BAR LOW IS EXIT
